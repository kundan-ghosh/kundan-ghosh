**`Digital Craftsman (Data Scientist / ML Engineer / LLM Researcher)`**

<p style="max-width: 600px; margin: auto; font-size: 16px;">
I’m a passionate data scientist & machine learning engineer shaping my own version of the intelligent digital world—one model at a time. My journey flows through mathematics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and finally LLMs.
  I deeply enjoy the craft of coding — because for me:
  “Codes are like magical mantras.
  I love learning them, shaping them, and creating magic through them.”  

My journey flows through <b>Mathematics → Data Science</b>.
### This is my choice — to be the person who builds, learns, and creates.
